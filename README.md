# Project
I'm going to use this project to put what I have learning of Python into practice.

This is a ATM app that I'm going to adjust during my Python learning journey

As I'm building this project, I also gaining knowledge of the scrum way of working. I use Jira for this (the retrospective is the hardest part ;-))
